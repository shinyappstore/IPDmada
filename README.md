# IPDmada: Analyze Patient Data Meta-Analyses of Diagnostic Test Accuracy

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/IPDmada](https://shinyappstore.com/a/IPDmada)__

IPDmada is an application designed for individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA). This application offers a comprehensive set of analyses applicable not only in IPD-MA but also in primary studies of diagnostic accuracy. The analyses provided by IPDmada include generating a summary table of patient characteristics, calculating various test performance measures, creating forest plots of sensitivity and specificity, and generating summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots for dichotomized tests. Additionally, IPDmada facilitates the examination of distribution of test results and ROC curves for continuous tests, forest plots of areas under the curve for continuous tests, and distribution of covariates along with covariate-adjusted ROC curves for in-depth covariate analysis. These functionalities collectively offer a thorough diagnostic test accuracy study. Original Publication: Res Synth Methods. 2021 Jan; 12(1): 45â€“54.
